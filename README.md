## Coding Kata Challenge
Hi there! <br><br>
In this challenge you will become a bartender! üç∏üçπüç∫ <br><br>
You have a list of drinks and their ingredients, along with the mixing time for each ingredient. You will need to implement a function `getMixingTime` that calculates the total mixing time for a given drink. <br>
- This function should take a `(drink)` name as an argument and return a string with the total mixing time for that drink.
- The total mixing time is the sum of the mixing times for all the ingredients in the drink.

Now... If an ingredient has no defined mixing time, the function should return a string saying so. If the drink is not in the `drinkRecipes` object, the function should return a string saying that it can't calculate the mixing time for that drink at this moment.

Good luck & enjoy! üçπ <br>
